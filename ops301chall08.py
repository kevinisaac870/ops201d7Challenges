# Purpose:      Create a Python script to use lists & sets.


# Assign to a variable a list of ten string elements.
vari_list = ["dog", "cat", "ape", "monkey", "orca", "dolphin", "seal", "kangaroo", "chimp", "elephant"]


# Print the fourth element of the list.
print(vari_list[3])

# Print the sixth through tenth element of the list.
print(vari_list[5:10])
# I got this to work, but do not understand how the square brackets work here in parenthesis but differently below.  I am reading up on this now.  Now that I am getting to
# understand how this works (somewhat better), I am really liking it.

# Change the value of the seventh element to "onion".
vari_list[6] = "onion"
print(vari_list)
