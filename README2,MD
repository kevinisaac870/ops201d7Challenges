# Ops201d7chanllenge14

What is this repo all about?
This repo is a collection of my coding challenges and the various scripts I have written.

Why are you learning these skills?
I am learning these skills because they are fundamental to today's computing world and the basis of most operating systems.  As a Cyber Security Professional I will need
to be well versed in these languages and their applicability.

What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
I learned the the basics of writing code in BASH and PowerShell; networking basics; using VirtualBox to create and manage virtual machines, within machines, within
machines, inside another machine and then I think one more inside of that.  The Matrix has nothing on this (besides the whole human harvesting thing).

What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
I'd have to say creating functions to answer inout questions.

How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
In a myriad of ways.  From monitoring employees' habits, files, downloads to keeping system logs and more.

What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
Honestly, all of them.

What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
Everything.  If I do not have a "mastery" of somehting I am not happy.
